======== INSTRUCTIONS ========

This is a simple Chess Clock with a Graphical User Interface programmed in Python 3.8.7 on MacOS 11.2 Big Sur.
To start the clock, press the green 'START' button, or press the 'S' key on your keyboard. The clock will start counting down, with white first (the running clock will be highlighted in neon green).
Once the start button has been clicked, you may press it again to reset the clock back to its original state.
Press the blue 'SWITCH' button, or the SpaceBar on your keyboard whenever you make a move. Doing so will stop your clock, add the increment/bonus time, and start the opponent's clock.
Press the grey 'PAUSE/RESUME' button to pause and resume the clock.
Press the white buttons to change time controls, and the 'CUSTOM' button to choose and make your time control.
If a player is low on time, a soft warning will play, and the clock will flash several times.
Once a player runs out of time, a bell sound will occur and the clock will turn red, and indication that the game is over.


======== TIME CONTROLS ========
A time control is represented by A+B, where A is the number of minutes to start, and B is the 'bonus' increment per move.
For instance, 10+5, a popular rapid time control, starts with 10 minutes on the clock and a 5-second increment added to your time after each move.
We provide quick, one-tap access to some of the most popular online time controls:
1+0   | Bullet
2+1   | Bullet
3+0   | Blitz
3+2   | Blitz
5+0   | Blitz
5+3   | Blitz
10+0  | Rapid
10+5  | Rapid
15+10 | Rapid
30+0  | Classical
30+20 | Classical

If you would like to play a time control not on this list, or a time imbalance, you may press the 'CUSTOM' button, which will prompt a small dialog to input the information for the time control.
